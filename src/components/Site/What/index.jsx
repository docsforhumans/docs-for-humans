      <p style={{paddingTop: '0.3em'}}>It’s nothing, really. <span style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Yet.</span> I made this site to gauge interest for an idea I have called “Docs For Humans.” The idea? Create a “wikipedia-like” documentation website for all the crazy tools web developers use, day in and day out.</p>
      <p>Since most open-source authors have about 0% of time in their lives to create really useful documentation, I thought we could all band together and create it for them. Together, we can create Tutorials, Guides, and API references that look more like <span style={{fontWeight: 800}}>words</span> and <span style={{fontWeight: 800}}>sentences</span> and <span style={{fontWeight: 800}}>real-life examples</span> and less like mathematical equations.</p>
      <p>If this sounds awesome to you, <span style={{fontWeight: 800}}>sign up using the button below.</span> The only thing I’m going to use your email for is to let you know if Docs For Humans is gonna be a real thing or not, so you can get involved.</p>
