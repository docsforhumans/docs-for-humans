      <p style={{paddingTop: '0.3em'}}><span style={{fontWeight: 800}}>I learned JavaScript in 2016.</span> It was a mad dash of learning, not only vanilla JavaScript, but all the crazy open-source libraries I’d be using, day to day. It was really, really frustrating. Like, really. It was almost like using a map that someone purposefully removed pieces from, or spilled their coffee on. I often felt direction-less. And all the README.MD’s that said “the source is self-explanatory” made me want to hurl their library into a bucket of <span style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>other</span> brown colored liquid.</p>
      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 800}}>So, why bother?</span> Because thousands of people are going through the same thing, right now. They’re called Junior Devs. They’re the future. And the more accessible an industry becomes, the better things are created with it. This is why.</p>
