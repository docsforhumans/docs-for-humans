Right now, I’m just gauging interest, seeing how much time I should pour into creating this. The best way I can do that is see a list of people who are actually interested. (The only thing I’m going to use your email for is to let you know if Docs For Humans is gonna be a real thing or not, so you can get involved.)</p>
      <p><span style={{fontWeight: 800, textDecoration: 'underline'}}>After that?</span> I’ll come up with a contribution method, likely through a Github repo. Then, everyone who wants to contribute, can. I want to make it relatively painless. No waiting forever for PR’s and all that. As for the writing, you could add to someone’s in-progress API Reference or tack on a new chapter to an unfinished tutorial. It’ll be like wikipedia, with version control.</p>
